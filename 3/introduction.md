# Introduction
## Introducing Python

This chapter covers the material for about the first month of the course, which is a basic introduction to Python. This is not an introduction to computer science. Our focus is no how to use Python as a tool for working with data. As such, our focus is on:
- learning the fundamentals of Python
- learning the fundamentals of programming logic
- using Python for data science, including:
    - reading data
    - manipulating/processing data (e.g., extracting specific data, splitting data according to variables, applying functions, combining data)
    - exploratory data analysis
    - basic statistical analyses of data sets

Each section of this chpater is a lesson, which will probably take you about 1-1.5 hours to complete. Each lesson is a Jupyter notebook, which will also be available to you on CoCalc. As well, there are videos posted in which the instructor walks through each notebook and explains things.

The best way to work through this material is to have the video open in one window, and CoCalc in another, and be tying in the code to follow along with the instructor. The copies of these chapters in this textbook serve more as a reference that you can check back with later.

After working through the lessons, you can get more practice with DataCamp. Refer to the course [schedule](https://dalpsychneuro.github.io/NESC_3505/schedule) to see which DataCamp lessons go with which course lessons. This chapter relates to the material taught in the first two DataCamp lessons, [Introduction to Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) and [Intermediate Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).
