# Getting Help on an Assignment

The primary way that you will interact with the teaching team while working on an assignment is via a GitHub [**Pull Request**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests). For each assignment, a pull request called  `Feedback` is automatically created for you by GitHub Classroom. This is how you should pose questions about the assignment to the teaching team. 

In a typical GitHub workflow, a Pull Request is a series of changes to a a repository, combined with comments from contributors. It's called a "Pull Request" because the idea is that someone could build some new feature, bugfix, etc. for a project and request that it be merged (pulled) into the main project. Pull requests allow developers to view the proposed code and comment on it, suggest additional changes, etc. before the code is accepted and merged into the main project. A cool thing about the Comments in Pull Requests is that you can tag a specific person, *and* a specific line(s) of code in a file. 

In GitHub Classroom, we are using the Pull Request workflow in a slightly different way. Your assignment isn't part of a bigger project (until we get to team assignments), but Pull Requests is simply a useful tool for chatting back and forth, within a repository. Because you can tie a comment to specific lines of code, it makes it quite easy to ask your TA deattiled questions and have them immediately be able to see where in your file the question is coming from.

Just keep in mind that what GitHub calls "Comments", you can use to ask questions.

## Creating a Comment to Get Help

You can create a comment either on the GitHub website, or directly from within VS Code

- you can use the GitHub Pull Request icon in the Activity Bar to create a comment in the PR
- you can @-mention someone (TA/instructor) in a comment --- or directly in your code file --- and they will get a notification via GitHub
- note that if you do not @-mention someone, they will not get notifications about any commits or comments you make
