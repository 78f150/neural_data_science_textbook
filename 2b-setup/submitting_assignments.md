# Submitting Assignments

If you're following this book as a course, you will be submitting assignments through GitHub Classroom. This is actually pretty straightforward --- as long as you have been committing your changes regularly and pushing them to GitHub, as soon as you've pushed the last change that is necessary to complete the assignment, you can consider it submitted. 

Each assignment has a due date that is clearly visible on GitHub Classroom. **GitHub will not allow you to push any changes to your assignment after that due date**. In other words, whenever you've finished the assignment, you can consider it submitted --- there is no extra "submit" step. 

## Late Work

The penalty for late work is clearly stated in the syllabus. However, as you may infer from the method of submission, it is not possible to submit work late. If you have a valid reason for submitting work late, please contact the instructor (not the TA) as early as possible. They can extend the due date for you at their discretion. But if you get locked out at the submission deadline, you will be locked out until the instructor unlocks you. You can, however, continue to work on your own computer, saving changes and committing them, and then push to GitHub if and when the instructor unlocks you.
