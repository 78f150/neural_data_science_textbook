    "# Working With Multiple Data Files Using Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will revisit some of the material covered at the end of the introductory chapter on Python. Specifically, reading multiple data files, manipulating the data using pandas, and deriving some basic information from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions are very high-level, because we want you to work on writing Copilot prompts yourself, based on high-level instructions rather than us giving you step-by step guidance. The version of this lesson in the online textbook, however, shows the worked example with prompts and Copilot-generated code."

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to perform the operations below, using Python code generated by a combination of your own writing, and GitHub Copilot's suggestions. For your own learning, you are best off to start each step by trying to write the code yourself. If it works, great – you've learned something in Python! Congratulations. But, tTe tasks below intentionally ask you to do things that we haven't taught in this course yet. That's because we want you to learn how to use Copilot to help you out when you don't know how to do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try writing your own code and it doesn't work, then you can try again, or use Copilot to help you out. Copilot is meant to speed up your coding, so in practice it's preferable to use it to help you out when you get stuck, than spend too much time trying to figure out how to do something yourself. On the other hand, once you have the solution from Copilot, it's important to try to understand what it is doing. You may have to look up some of the functions it's using, if you're not familiar with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're ignorant of what the code you generated is doing, you risk errors. Indeed, in the tutorial below we will see an example of Copilot's generating erroneous code. Even if the code works as desired, it is important for you to be able to explain correctly what you did. Also, look for ways to check that the results you get are correct (using code). \n"

    "### The Data and What to Do With It\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three data files in the `data` directory: `s1.csv`, `s2.csv`, and `s3.csv`. Each file contains the reaction times (RTs) from 10 trials of a relatively simple task in which participants had to indicate which direction a briefly-presented arrow was pointing. The RTs are in seconds (s). Each file contains the RTs from a different participant. In each file there are three columns. You can determine what the columns are by looking at the first row (header) of each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate code that reads in the three files and combines them in a pandas DataFrame. Include error-checking  code that determines you loaded in the correct number of trials (30) and the correct number of columns (3). If the number of trials or columns is incorrect, print an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the dataframe to a file called `all_data.csv`, in the `data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the DataFrame, calculate:\n",
    "- the mean RT for each participant\n",
    "- the mean RT across all participants\n",
    "- the 95% confidence intervals for the mean RT for each participant\n",
    "- the 95% confidence intervals for the mean RT across all participants\n",
    "\n",
    "Print all of the above results to the screen, rounded to 2 decimal places and with accompanying text that indicates what each result is. Be sure that it is clear that RT is in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well, generate a plot of the mean RT for each participant, with error bars showing the 95% confidence intervals."

    "### How to Approach This Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical skill to develop in coding is **problem decomposition** – in other words, breaking down a task into smaller and smaller components, so that you can write the code to perform each step in the logical sequence. The instructions above are written in a sequential way, so you should be able to identify each individual step that  you need to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice, when working in Jupyter notebooks, to write the code for each step in a separate cell. This makes it easier to test each step, and to go back and change things if you need to. It also makes it easier to see what you've done, and understand what the code is doing. As well, it's sometime helpful to put Markdown cells in between code cells, to provide longer explanations than might be appropriate for a comment in the code itself. You can also make notes about things you might want to change later, or interpretations of the output of the code."

    "### Using the Copilot Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, we encourage you to try writing the code for each step of the instructions above. Coding is a *procedural* skill that you only learn by doing — and the more you learn the better you will be at solving the bugs that Copilot-generated code will inevitably have. But, if you get stuck, or encounter an instruction that you haven't yet learned how to perform in Python, then by all means use Copilot. Just like writing your own code, it is best if you use a separate notebook cell for each Copilot prompt. That way, if you need to edit the code, you can do so without having to re-run all of the code that Copilot generated. It's also easier to debug because you can see the output of each cell and now exactly which line generated the error."

    "The cells below all reflect prompts written on the basis of the instructions above, and code generated entirely by Copilot. As you will see, it takes some trial and error – and critical thinking – to generate prompts that produce the code you want. But, it's a good way to learn how to use Copilot effectively. And if you do it right, you will learn a lot about Python along the way."

    "### Copilot `Explain This`\n",
    "\n",
    "A great place to start in diagnosing errors is `Explain This`. Intuitively, you might go straight for `Fix This`. However, it's probably instructive to see what Copilot thinks your code is doing, and if that is what *you* think your code is doing. Copilot's explanation might give you insight into the error. Below is the output from selecting `Explain This` for the line of code that caused the error above:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This code is designed to calculate the mean reaction time (RT) for each subject in a dataframe. The code uses the groupby() method to group the data by the 'subject' column and then calculates the mean for each group using the mean() method.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The resulting dataframe contains the mean RT for each subject. The index of the dataframe is the unique values in the 'subject' column, and the columns are the other numerical columns in the original dataframe.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This code is useful when working with data that has multiple subjects and you want to calculate summary statistics for each subject. By using the groupby() method, you can easily calculate summary statistics for each group without having to manually subset the data.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> One possible way to improve this code would be to specify the column to calculate the mean for, rather than calculating the mean for all numerical columns. This would make the code more specific and reduce the risk of errors. Additionally, the code could be modified to calculate other summary statistics, such as the standard deviation or median, by using the appropriate method instead of the mean() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, this shows how Copilot can be a great learning tool. It's giving us a clear explanation of what the code is doing, and teaching us a bit about how the `.groupby()` method works. It also suggests some improvements to the code, which we can take or leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of this explanation tells us directly why the code generates an error, but at least we have an explanation of what the code is actually doing, which we can use to help us figure out what is going wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first paragraph of Copilot's explanation notes that the code is grouping the data by the `subject` column. This could be a clue to us, since the error message also references `subject`. "

    "\n",
    "If you select `Fix This` from the Copilot menu, you will see what's called a **diff**, as shown below. A diff is a way of showing the difference between two pieces of code. The code on the left (with a pink background) is the code you wrote, and the code on the right (with a green background) is the code that Copilot suggests. In this case, the suggested \"fix\" would not fix the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/copilot_fix_this.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested code is doing two things differently from the original code. Firstly, it's suggesting that you assign the output of the command to a variable, and then print the variable. Assigning output to a variable and then printing it is in general good coding style, because we may want to use that variable again later in our code. But that won't fix the error. A\n",
    "\n",
    "The other difference – which is subtle to a novice coder – is that the new code is referencing the column `Subject` rather than `subject`. Recall that Python is **case-sensitive**, meaning that `Subject` and `subject` are not the same thing. Copilot seems to be guessing that the error might be cause by a common mistake, which is to refer to a variable using the wrong case. \n",

    "This is a frightening example of a Copilot **hallucination**. The above code generates what you might think is a plausible result. However, there are a couple of problems. Firstly, confidence intervals (CIs) are typically reported as a pair of values. The 95% CIs reflect the range within which it is 95% likely that the true mean lines, so we need an upper and lower range of these values. These are typically the same amount plus or minus from the mean. So we need to modify the code to generate the upper and lower values of the CIs. \n",

    "Secondly, if you look back at the mean RT for each participant, they were in the range of .339 – .449. Confidence intervals reflect the range of possible true values for the mean, given the sample data.  So for our confidence intervals to have values around 5 s seems implausible, given the mean RTs are < 500 ms. We would expect the CIs to be perhaps 100-200 ms. So it seems like Copilot is actually calculating the CIs incorrectly. \n",

In this case, I was being sloppy with capitalization in my prompts.
