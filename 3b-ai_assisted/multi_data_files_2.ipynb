    "```python\n",
    "# calculate the mean RT across all participantID\n",
    "```\n",

    "Rather than trying either of these, let's first analyze them to try to understand what each is doing. The first option uses the `groupby` method to group the data by the `participantID` column, and then calculates the mean for each group. However, we don't want to calculate the mean for each group, we want to calculate the mean for all groups. Secondly, the command does not specify that we want the mean only for the reaction time column.\n",

    "At this point, we could use Copilot Chat again, but it might be more efficient to try writing the code ourselves, by adapting the second Copilot suggestion. The command is an example of **chaining**, in which several methods are applied in sequence to the same object. In this case, the object is the DataFrame `df`, and the methods are `.groupby()` and `.mean()`, which would be executed in sequence, from left to right. So what if we simply remove the `.groupby()` method? Let's try that; we'll copy and past the command (and its comment) into the code cell below, and then edit it. We need to be sure to keep the `[\"RT\"]` part though!"

    "This is a frightening example of a Copilot **hallucination**. The above code generates a table of numbers, one for each participantID.  You might think this is a plausible result. However, there are a couple of problems. Firstly, confidence intervals (CIs) are typically reported as a pair of values. The 95% CIs reflect the *range* within which it is 95% likely that the true mean lies, so we need an upper *and* lower limits of the CI. These are typically the same amount plus or minus the mean (e.g., if the mean is 2, the 95% CIs might be 1.5 and 2.5). So given a conceptual understanding of what CIs are, we recognize that we need to modify the code to generate the upper and lower values of the CIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, if you look back at the mean RT for each participant, they were in the range of .339 â€“ .449. Again, confidence intervals reflect the range of possible true values for the mean, given the sample data.  So for our confidence intervals to have values around 5 s seems implausible, given the mean RTs are < 500 ms. We would expect the CIs to be perhaps 100-200 ms. So it seems like Copilot is calculating the CIs incorrectly.\n",

Sometimes we can get away with such simple prompts, but when they fail, we can try to break down the task into a sequence of steps, and then write prompts for each step.

    "This code illustrates a feature of Python that we haven't seen before: using a comma to separate two commands. This is a way of executing two commands in a single line of code. It's not a very common way of writing code, but as you can see in this example, it can be useful: the output is a Python `tuple`, which is an immutable, ordered collection of values. This is a good type to use when you have a pair of values that belong together, and the immutable nature of tuples means that you can't accidentally change one of the values. Furthermore, the ordering means you can access the values by their position in the tuple, which is useful in this case because, using this prompt, Copilot will always put the upper CI first and the lower CI second."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now completed the task of calculating the mean RT and 95% CIs for each participant, and for all participants. We've also learned a lot about how to use Copilot to help us write code, and how to use Copilot Chat to help us understand errors and fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen, the process of using AI to generate code isn't always smooth, nor are the results always accurate. It's critical to critically assess the outputs you see, and to understand what you are asking Copilot to do â€”Â as well as what the code it generates is doing. In this lesson, for the sake of expediency and length we did not provide detailed explanations of what the code was doing every step of the way. However, you've seen that Copilot can be useful at explaining code for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were also many points in this lesson where, as an experienced coder, I knew what the problem was and how to fix it. However, I deliberately did not fix the problems myself, because I recognize that as a novice coder you may not know how to fix the problems. Hopefully this lesson has shown you how to use Copilot effectively, but also underscored the value of actually knowing Python and being able to read and debug code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach to learning to use Python for data science is to write code yourself when you can,  because this helps build and reinforce your knowledge (remember, coding is a procedural skill that you only learn by doing â€”Â and you lose the knowledge if you don't use it). But, when you encounter a problem you've never solved before, or are getting errors in your Code, Copilot can be a huge help to deepen your knowledge and solve problems. As we've seen, Copilot Chat can be much more useful in this regard than simply writing prompts in code cells of your notebook, because it gives you both code, and detailed explanations of what that code is doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Copilot in Later Chapters of this Book\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout most of the rest of this book, we focus on teaching you to write code yourself, rather than using Copilot. We believe â€”Â and feel this lesson has demonstrated â€”Â that learning to write code yourself is the best way to learn to code. However, whether you're taking this course for credit and have assignments that Copilot may be useful in helping with, or simply using this book to learn how to apply Python to your own data, we recognize that Copilot can be a useful tool. We hope this chapter has given you a good introduction to how to use Copilot effectively, and that you will continue to use it on your coding journey."
