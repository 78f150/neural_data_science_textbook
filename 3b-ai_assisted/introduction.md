# AI-Assisted Coding

In this chapter we introduce [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI-assisted programming tool that can help you write code. We will revisit some of the fundamental coding concepts that we introduced in the previous chapter, but this time we will use GitHub Copilot to help us write the code. As you will see, this is not always as straightforward and magical as you might hope. AI-generated code often contains bugs, and it is important to understand how to debug code that you did not write yourself. Fortunately, Copilot can also help with this, although there are still situations where you will need to apply your own knowledge of coding.
