    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson we will start exploring how to use GitHub Copilot to generate code for us. We do this by creating natural language prompts (i.e., writing instructions for what you want  the code to do, the way you would say it to another human), and sometimes starting to type a bit of code to get the process started. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the generative nature of LLMs like GitHub Copilot, the results will not be the same every time you give it the same prompt. Thus as you're following along with this lesson, Copilot may generate different code that you see here. That's normal! It also means that you may need to experiment with different ways of phrasing a prompt, to get the result you want. You can also ask Copilot to generate alternative code solutions to your prompt, by pressing `Option+[` (or `Start+[` on Windows) after you get the first code suggestion (note that you have to wait until Copilot generates a suggestion before pressing those keys). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisities\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already have followed all the steps in the chapter, [Set Up Your Computer for Data Science](../2b-setup/introduction.md), including installing VS Code and all the recommended extensions. This includes the GitHub Copilot extension. You should also have set up your GitHub account in VS Code, and l,ogged in to the GitHub Copilot extension using your GitHub account (the extension will routinely pop up messages with a button for you to do this, if you installed the extension but didn't connect it to your GitHub account yet). \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted earlier, GitHub Copilot is a paid add-on from GitHub. It is free for students, but you need to get access by signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Others with academic afilliations, like professors and postdocs, can also get free access to GitHub Copilot by applying for the [GitHub Teacher Benefits](https://education.github.com/teachers). If you are not affiliated with an educational institution, however, you will need to get a paid subscription to GitHub Copilot in order to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have GitHub Copilot installed and connected to your GitHub account, you can start using it in VS Code. You may have turned it off to do the lessons in the previous chapter. If so, you can turn it back on by clicking on the GitHub Copilot icon in the bottom right of the VS Code window (if unsure, move your cursor across the bottom toolbar until you see `Activate Copilot`).\n",

    "## How to Prompt Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous lesson we learned about **comments**, which are lines in your code that are not executed, but are there to help you and others understand what the code is doing. In Python, comments start with a `#` symbol. Python will not treat anything after the `#` symbol as code; it will ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With GitHub Copilot activated, it will read your comments as prompts, and use them to generated suggested code. For example, if you type the following code into a cell in a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of numbers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then press `Enter`, Copilot will generate the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggestions appear as fainter text than code you type yourself. That's how you can tell it's a suggestion. You can accept the suggestion by pressing `Tab`. If you press `Tab`, the suggestion will be inserted into your code, and will appear normal brightness rather than faded. If you don't want to accept the suggestion, you can press `Start+]` (`Option+]` on a Mac) to get an alternative suggestion (Copilot doesn't always have alternative suggestions though). If you don't want to accept any of the suggestions, you can just keep typing your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    ":exclamation: You can also use Copilot to generate code by typing a prompt that is not a comment. However, this is not recommended, because when you try to run the cell, Python will try to execute the prompt as code, and will give you an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing about using comments to generate code is that your code retains the prompts you used, which aids in transparency and reproducibility (to the extent that Copilot produces consistent results). It also means that for your future self, or others who might try to understand your code, the comments will be there to help them understand what the code is doing. Including comments like this has always been good practice, but often people focused on writing the code and included comments as an afterthought, if at all. With Copilot, you can write the comments first, and then use them to generate the code, which ensures a better quality of documentation."

In this case, you can backspace otherwise move your cursor to the end of the prompt line, and hit `Enter` again to get the suggestion back."

Even though we asked it to create a list of numbers, it didn't regenerate the code that defines the list of numbers, because it already did that in the previous cell. This is one of the many cool things about Copilot --- it is sensitve to the entire *context* of your notebook (i.e., code cells above and below the cell you're working on), and will use that context to generate suggestions. It's even sensitive to other files in your project, as we will see soon.\n",

    "## Combine Two Lists\n",
    "We're hopeful that you remembered how to create a list in Python from the previous chapter --- that's pretty fundamental. But do you remember how to combine two lists? Maybe not. It's a bit tricky, because if you get it wrong you'll end up with a list of lists, rather than a single list. Copilot can help with this. In the code cell below, define the two lists as shown (Copilot will probably help you with this), then type the following prompt as a comment, then press `Tab` to get a suggestion from Copilot (from here onward, we're just going to tell you what prompts to use, and assume you'll always remember to use `Tab` to accept a suggestion, and Shift+Enter to run the cell).\n",
    "\n",
    ":exclamation:\n",
    "You may also notice that Copilot not only generates code from prompts --- *it often will generate your prompts for you! Once you get over the initial spookiness (or apparent telepathy) of this, you'll realize that this is actually a very useful feature, because it can help you learn how to phrase prompts, and save you time typing. However, sometimes the prompts it generates are not quite what you want, so you may need to either cycle through alternative suggestions (`Option+[` or `Start+[`), or just type the prompt you actually want."

That's when we split the data into different groups (e.g., according to a paricular variable), apply an operation to each group separately, and then combine the results back into a single table. Let's try that again, but this time we'll use Copilot to help us.\n",

We'll start with a very high-level prompt, and see if we get what we want. Note that in the code cell below, I only typed the first three-line prompt. Copilot generated the rest of the code, including a series of prompts (comments) to help me fill in the details. In order to get it to generate additiona prompts and code, I had to hit enter twice after the first prompt. Apparently Copilot is insistent that your code be nicely formatted, with empty lines between different sections of code that do different steps. This is a good thing, but if you forget to hit `Enter` twice, you may get nothing an think Copilot isn't working. Just hit `Enter` twice, and you should get the prompts you need. Otherwise, try going back to the end of your prompt and hitting `Enter` again."

    "Can you figure out why this error happened? Ideally, you should be able to do this by re-reading the code the Copilot generated. But, the error message also provides guidance, because it tells us there is an error on line 7 (this information is near the top of the error message), and the error is `KeyError: 'group'`. That means that `gapminder_europe` doesn't have a column named `group`. Indeed, if we look at line 7 we see it's attempting to group the data by two columns, `year` and `group`. But `gapminder_europe` doesn't have a column named `group`, which is why we got an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually a few problems with this code. Not only does `group` not exist as a column, but it's not a great name for a column, because the column should indicate region of Europe. So a better name would be `region`. Another issue is that the `.groupby()` method was given another variable, `year`. But our instructions didn't say anything about year, so we don't want to group by year. We just want to group by region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try fix those issues through better prompt engineering. One thing you'll encounter frequently is that you give Copilot too big a job, and doing what you're asking will require a number of internediate steps. Copilot isn't great about long-term planning. Remember that LLMs are just advanced versions of the same kind of language model that suggests words when you're typing on your phone. It's often good at predicting the next word you want to type, but if you keep just picking the \"best\" suggestion, you will get a sentence of gibberish more times than not. The same is true with Copilot. If you give it a big job, it will often generate code that doesn't work, because it's trying to do too much at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you need to break the job down into smaller steps. In this case, we're doing split-apply-combine, so let's try writing our own prompts for each of those conceptual stepss. So let's start with the first step, 'split', and see if we can get Copilot to generate the code to group the data by region."

In the previous chapter, we had to manually create lists for each region label, containing the names of each country in that region. We could do that here to help Copilot along, but hopefully AI is smart enough to know what geographical region each European country is in. This is a reasonable prediction in this case, especailly because the open-source Gapminder dataset is widely used in teaching data science, so there should be many versions of this specific example in Copilot's training set.
