# Yammer

Yammer is an instant messaging platform operated by Microsoft. While Teams has instant messaging built in via channels, Yammer offers a richer platform, including the ability to send others kudos for jobs well done (great for class demos, team work, and general good will!), to post quick polls, and other things you'll discover.

Official class announcements will come through Teams channels, but Yammer can be used for your one-on-one and team chats, as well as for fun and stress relief (within, of course, [Dalhousie's Code of Student Conduct](https://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/policies/student-life/code-of-student-conduct.html)!).
