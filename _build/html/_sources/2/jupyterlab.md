# JupyterLab

[**JupyterLab**](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a full-fledged *environment* for working with Jupyter notebooks, that runs through a web browser. It allows you to navigate the filesystem on the computer it's running on; and open, edit, and run not only Jupyter notebook files, but other types of files (like text files); access the documentation for the language you are using;Â and use a terminal to access the command line. You can have many windows open at once, and arrange them in a tabbed environment.

The example below shows the list of files in the current directory on the left, an open Python notebook file in the middle, with a terminal below it, and on the right the launcher (which allows you to create new files and terminal windows), and the JupyterLab documentation.

In this course, virtually all of your work will be performed in JupyterLab.
