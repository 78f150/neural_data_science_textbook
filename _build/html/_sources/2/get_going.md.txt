# Get Going!

Congratulations, you've made it through the first two chapters of the course — the pre-reading! Assuming you've already checked out the Teams site, there's not much more to do before the first class.

Since this is an asynchronous online course, one of the first challenges is getting organized, and getting going. There is no classroom to show up in at the appointed hour for your first class. BUT, we will have a first class meeting, live on Teams, for those who are able to participate. This is noted on the schedule, and a link to the Teams meeting will be found in your Teams calendar. At class time, you can click "Join" on the calendar event to join the class. If you're not able to join in by video (or even just audio), that's OK, but you may want to introduce yourself in the course Yammer chat. We also encourage those of you with pets to share your pet pix to the "Pet Photos" channel on Teams! Try these and other creative ways to break the ice and get to know your classmates, however virtually.

The other thing is getting yourself organized. The "Getting Started" section of this book provided some pointers and thoughts on that. In general, the 7-week summer intensive version of this course has three levels of structure. At the highest level, the **course** level, the first half of the course is focused largely on teaching you Python, with assignments that let you put your learning into practice working with real neuroscience data. The second half of the course contains fewer required DataCamp lessons. Instead, each week introduces a new type of data (single unit, EEG, MRI) and teaches you how to work with that data in Python. The course wraps up with Project 2, which is a major project where your team will pick a new dataset to work with, and do data science things to it, with the goal of deriving and communicating meaning and insights from the data.

The next level organization is **weekly**. Early in each week, you are expected to do lessons online and develop some new understanding. On Wednesdays, there is a live, synchronous check-in session which you can optionally attend. This is like "office hours" — it's generally unstructured time when you can ask questions and get help from the teaching team. On Fridays, we have **Demo Day** (more below). In the first half of the course, you should aim to have completed one DataCamp lesson by Monday, and one by Wednesday, as specified in the schedule. Once you've completed the week's DataCamp lessons, you should start working on that week's assignment (or project). In the second half of the course, there won't be many DataCamp lessons, but instead there will be video tutorials on that week's data. Assignments are due the following Monday. Ideally, however, you should try to complete the assignment by Friday — or at least start it. The demos produced for Demo Days could include help with assignments, and the teaching team is *not* available for help on weekends. So, you may be at a disadvantage if you wait until the weekend to start working on an assignment.

## Demo Days

Based on workflows in Silicon Valley and the tech industry, the idea of Demo Days is that you can learn a lot from each other — and often, your classmates (who are in the same "boat" as you in terms of learning) can have more sensitivity and shared experience in the learning process than the teaching team. As described in the syllabus, demos are short demonstrations that you prepare to teach your fellow students. They can be videos (1-3 min) or written (500-1000 words). The goal is to share some insight or discovery with other students. This could be how you approached and solved some problem in an assignment, a review of a website, or a good YouTube tutorial, or other resources you found helpful for the class, etc.. Grading will be based on a rubric with four components: quality of presentation, quality of work, relevance/usefulness of topic, and creativity. You don't have to attend Demo Days synchronously, but you are expected to submit a demo by the Demo Day deadline each week.
