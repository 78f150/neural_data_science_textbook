# Putting It All Together

OK, so that's a lot of tech! Your head may be spinning right now. That's OK. We'll try to keep things organized. Assignment 1 for this course will actually take you through getting set up on CoCalc and going with many aspects of the course.

Your central hub for the course is the Teams site. When in doubt, go there. The course Teams site has links to everything you need, including the syllabus, course schedule, DataCamp, videos, textbook, CoCalc, and assignments. Teams is also where you can ask questions, using the chat features, and where you can join synchronous class meetings or start video chats with the teaching team or classmates. You should check out the course Teams site now, if you haven't already!
