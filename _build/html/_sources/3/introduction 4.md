# Introduction
## Introducing Python

This chapter relates to the material taught in the first two DataCamp lessons, [Introduction to Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) and [Intermediate Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). As the names imply, these will be your first steps in learning the Python language.

This, and subsequent chapters that are aligned with DataCamp lessons, do not replace the material in those lessons. Instead, they are intended as reference material or "cheat sheets" that you can use when working on the course assignments and projects, rather than having to go back and re-watch videos on DataCamp.
