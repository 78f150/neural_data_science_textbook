<h1>Spreadsheets<a class="headerlink" href="#spreadsheets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A wide variety of different software packages and platforms are used in data science. You have probably worked with some of these in the past. Probably most people’s first introduction to working with data is using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Spreadsheets provide a <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong> that allows the user to enter data into a <strong>table</strong>, which is composed of individual <strong>cells</strong> organized into <strong>rows</strong> and <strong>columns</strong>. Cells can contain different types of data, like numbers, letters, words, and sentences. Cells can also contain more complex data, like equations that calculate values, often based on data contained in other cells. Spreadsheets can be used to create visualizations of data — such as graphs — and perform simple statistical analyses, such as <em>t</em>-tests.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are useful tools for quickly inspecting data, and manually entering data if you need to do that. They limited in many ways, however. For one thing, they are not generally efficient in performing repetitive tasks. For example, imagine you ran a simple behavioural reaction time (RT) experiment in which participants had to press a button as quickly as possible upon seeing a visual stimulus. For our example, we’re going to use a simple “flanker” task with two conditions: participants have to press wither the left or right arrow key, to indicate whether an arrow shown on the screen is pointing left or right. However, the catch is that the centre arrow is “flanked” by two other arrows on each side; these can be pointing the same way as the target arrow (congruent):</p>
<p><img alt="flanker_congruent" src="../_images/flanker_congruent&#64;0.75x.png" /></p>
<p>or in the opposite direction (incongruent)</p>
<p><img alt="flanker_incongruent" src="../_images/flanker_incongruent&#64;0.75x.png" /></p>
<p>We expect that the incongruent condition would be associated with slower RTs, because the flanking arrows create some visual confusion and response competition. To estimate the average RT for each condition for an individual, we would want to present many trials of each condition, in random order — since human RTs even for simple button presses are variable. We might want to include 50 trials per condition, per participant. To estimate the average human RT for each condition (and the difference between conditions), you would need to test not one person, but many; for our example, let’s say we tested 50 people. For each person, you would collect data from many trials (instances where the participant saw a stimulus and made a button press). This experiment would be run on a computer, which would save a data file for each participant. So you now have a data file from each participant, that you could open in Excel. An example is shown in the figure below, showing the first 10 trials for one participant (identified as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">subj_01</span></code>).</p>
<p><img alt="example spreadsheet" src="../_images/spreadsheet_RT_data.png" /></p>
<p>In this file, each row would represent a trial, except for the first row, which is the <strong>header</strong> that labels each column. Each data row (numbered 2-11 in the spreadsheet) contains columns identifying the participant; the trial number, the condition (congruent or incongruent), and the RT (in seconds).</p>
<p>Since our goal is to estimate the average RT for each condition, we could use Excel’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVERAGE</span></code> function for this. However, we can’t simply put the formula
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=AVERAGE(D2:D101)</span></code> below the bottom row (remember, we ran 100 trials, even though only the first 10 are shown in the example above). This would give us the average RT for that participant, but would not provide separate RTs for each condition. Since the conditions are randomly intermixed, calculating the RT for each condition is actually a bit challenging. However, we could use Excel’s “sort” function to sort the data by column C, which would result in all the congruent trials coming first, and the incongruent ones after. Then, we could insert two <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVERAGE</span></code> formulas, one for each condition.</p>
<p>Since in our example we tested 50 participants, we would have to perform this process manually 50 times: open a data file, sort by column D, type in two formulas, and computer the averate RTs for each condition. Then we could copy and paste these into a new spreadsheet, that had one row and two columns (mean congruent RT, mean incongruent RT) for each subject. Once we had done this 50 times, we could use Excel’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVERAGE</span></code> function again to compute the mean RT across participants for each condition. To please our stats teacher, we might also compute the standard deviation (a measure of variability) across the subjects, which would be another equation put in another cell.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There is nothing fundamentally incorrect with this process, and it would yield the correct values for the data. However, there are a number of issues with this workflow. Before reading on, try to think of some!</p>
</div>
<p>…OK, so here are some issues with this “manual” process of doing data science:</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s tedious. You are doing the same thing — computing the average RT for each participant and condition — 100 times. While maybe you can get into a groove, with some chill music playing and a nice cup of coffee, it’s still tedious and probably not the best use of your time. On top of that, it’s <strong>error prone</strong>. You might make typos, you might accidentally miss including some rows for some subjects, you might forget to do one subject’s data file, you might accidentally swap the congruent and incongruent values for one participant during the copying process, etc.. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a machine that could do this automatically, and far more quickly and accurately than you? Then you would have more free time to just enjoy that coffee and music!</p>
<p>Another issue is that the manual process is not readily <strong>scalable</strong>: if you ran another experiment with 100 participants, you would be bringing twice as much boredom, tedium, and risk of human error as in your first experiment.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the manual process is not easily <strong>reproducible</strong>. That is to say, if you ran a new experiment, you would have to perform the same tedious process all over again, with the same risks of human error and terminal boredom. And if you wanted someone else to do the analysis for you, you would need to write out instructions and hope that they followed those instructions exactly. Furthermore, as often happens, if you were a student in the lab who graduates and moves on before the study is finished, someone else may be assigned to finish the data analysis, and they would have to figure out what you did, how you organized your files, etc.. In many cases when this happens, people have to start from scratch because the pervious person’s process was not clearly documented, and it’s very hard to check for errors except by going through a large number of files.</p>
<p>There has to be a better way!</p>
