# Get Going!

Congratulations, you've made it through the first two chapters of the course — the pre-reading! Assuming you've already checked out the Teams site, there's not much more to do before the first class.

The first live class session will be an in-person "lab", where we'll review course material and get acquainted. This will be livestreamed and recorded for those who don't attend in person.

## Organization of the Course

The other thing is getting yourself organized. The "Getting Started" section of this book provided some pointers and thoughts on that. As a broad overview, the course starts with an introduction to Python, and teaches you basic coding skills. After the first month, we start to focus more on using Python to work with neural data, including single-cell recordings, then EEG, then MRI data. Finally, at the end of the course we cover machine learning and apply it to neural data.
