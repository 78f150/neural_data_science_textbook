# Learning Management System

A learning management system (LMS) is a platform for managing online learning. At Dalhousie, most classes use Brightspace as their LMS. Brightspace is a commercial product from D2L, and is used by many universities and colleges around the world. Brightspace is a powerful tool, but it is not open source, and it is not free. It is also not the only option for an LMS. In this class, we will use GitHub as our LMS. GitHub is a free and open source platform for managing code and other digital assets. It is widely used in the software development community, and is increasingly used in other fields as well. GitHub is a powerful tool, and it is free to use for public repositories. It is also a great way to build your portfolio of work, which you can use to demonstrate your skills to potential employers.
