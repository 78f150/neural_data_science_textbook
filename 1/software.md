# Free Software

The free software movement can be traced back to Richard Stallman who, in 1983, announced the GNU Project. "GNU" (pronounced with a hard "g", like "guh-NOO") is a recursive acronym for "GNU's not Unix"; Unix was a family of proprietary computer operating systems developed by various companies, and Stallman's aim was to create an alternative operating system that was free of any proprietary or commercial restrictions. Stallman had observed that free software fostered cooperation and  collaboration among users, leading to improvements and innovation. However, by 1908, virtually all software was proprietary, which prevents collaboration. Stallman's goal was for people to be able to use a computer in any way they wished, without any proprietary software. Since the operating system of a computer is the core base on which all other software runs, the first goal of the GNU movement was to build a completely free operating system. This was finally realized with the release of Linux in 1991, although the GNU software project comprises a much wider range of software than just the Linux OS.

In Stallman's framing, **free software** meets the following criteria: "The freedom to run the program as you wish; the freedom to copy the program and give it away to your friends and co-workers; the freedom to change the program as you wish, by having full access to source code; the freedom to distribute an improved version and thus help build the community." [https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html).

You may have also heard the term "open source" to refer to software. The open source movement is closely related to the free software movement, but distinct in important ways. Indeed, there is an [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/), and organization distinct from the Free Software Foundation, which on its own reflects distinct goals and ideologies. Open source software is that for which the source code is made freely available, just like free software. However, while licenses on free software are **copyleft**, meaning that every person who receives a copy of the software is permitted to reproduce, adapt, or distribute it, *but* they can only do so under the same licensing terms as the original. Open source software, on the other hand, can carry more restrictive licenses, such as making the source code freely available, but putting more restrictions on software built from that source code. As well, open software can be *tivoized*, meaning that although the software is free, it will only run on proprietary hardware (so-named for the Tivo product that first used this scheme).

## Free and Open-Source Software Licenses

There are a variety of free and open-source software licenses, which differ in the restrictions they place on use of the software. While this may seem a bit technical, as a newbie entering the world of data science it is important to have at least a basic understanding of these. For one thing, it could protect you from a legal violation in the future. For another, you will be using free software, and writing software, so it's worth thinking about why and how the tools you use exist, and how you might wish to license your own code.

Some of the most commonly-used free software licenses are the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html), the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), the [BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), and [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses. Wikipedia has an extensive [list of free and open-source software licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licences) which compares them on their critical dimensions. Some of the most important dimensions to consider are the following. **Linking** refers to whether the code can be linked with code that carries a different license. **Distribution** refers to whether recipients of the software can redistribute it. **Modification** concerns whether recipients can modify the code. **Patent grant** concerns whether licensees are protected from patent claims regarding the software. **Private use** refers to whether licensees can modify the code for private use or, conversely, if any modifications must be made public. **Sublicensing** refers to whether modified code can be licensed under a different license (e.g., if code can be slightly modified, and then copyrighted for commercial use).

Ultimately, the differences between these licenses largely reflect a tradeoff between concepts of freedom and permissiveness. A more *permissive* license places fewer restrictions on how the software can be used and re-used. For example, software released under an MIT license can be reused in proprietary software. In contrast, software released under the GPL carries a **copyleft**, which means that it cannot be modified and re-distributed under a different or more restrictive license. The term "copyleft" is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek play on "copyright"; whereas copyright is typically used by authors to restrict others' ability to reproduce or modify a work, copyleft is intended to explicitly allow others to do these things, *and* prevent others from placing more restrictive licenses on derivations of the copylefted work. Placing a copyleft or other "share-alike" restriction on software in a sense reflects a more anti-corporate ideology, whereby the author limits some uses of their work, in return for the protection that it always be free.
