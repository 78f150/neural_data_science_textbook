# Assessment and Evaluation

This is a university course, and so you will receive a grade at the end of it. This grade is meant to reflect the quality of your work and how well you met the learning objectives of the course.

Although they may seem like similar concepts, there is an important difference between "assessment" and "evaluation" {cite}`conrad_assessment_2018`. Formally, **assessment** refers to ongoing feedback from the teaching team, your peers, and your own self-assessment of your performance. The goal of assessment is to help you learn, and improve your performance. For this reason it is often called **formative** — as in, helping to "form" and shape a better you.

Conversely, **evaluation** is **summative** — it is intended to "sum up" your performance in the course, and is used to determine your course grade. Whereas assessment is intended to be an ongoing process, evaluation is a judgement applied at the end of the course, or your work on a particular assignment, of how well you met the objectives. 

# Everyone starts with an F

One of the game-like elements this course employs is a cumulative approach to grading, based on the notion of **experience points** (**XP**). You likely have experience playing video games, like RPGs (role-playing games), in which your character starts at level 0, and over time levels up by completing tasks, like quests or battles, which reward you with XP. The more challenges you complete, the more XP you gain, and the higher your character's level becomes, usually up to some top level.

In this course, you start with 0 XP, which equates to a grade of "F". Your challenge is to gain enough XP to achieve the grade you desire. XP are gained by completing assignments (in some cases, )




## Deadlines

As with any course, there are assignments with deadlines. Deadlines exist for a few reasons. For one, they are designed to keep you on track; the work in this course is cumulative, and largely entails learning how to do things (rather than memorizing knowledge for later regurgitation) — so if you fall behind, it will be increasingly hard to catch up. Due dates are also part of this courses' emulation of professional working environments: in the real world, projects have deadlines and meeting this is usually critical to the ongoing success and reputation of the organization.

At the same time, it is recognized that over the 7-13 weeks of a course, life happens, sometimes in ways that interfere with completing work. For this reason, evaluation components have some flexibility built into them, for example allowing you to choose which assignment scores you want to contribute to your final grade (within limits; see syllabus). As well, assignments with due dates have a late policy of deducting 1% from the final grade per hour that the assignment is late; this is meant to encourage timeliness, but impose relatively little penalty for "almost on time" work or last-minute hiccups.
