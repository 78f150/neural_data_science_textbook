## Hard Skills
- extract meaning from data, but also articulate the limitations of the conclusions you can draw from it
- Write functional and efficient code in Python to perform basic data science tasks
- use GitHub for collaborative software development and project management
- Read and write data files in common formats such as CSV and Excel
- Organize and manipulate data structures
- Work with continuous, discrete, and factorial data
- Visualize data in a variety of graphical formats
- Perform exploratory data analysis using graphical and basic statistical operations
- Perform basic signal processing on data, such as filtering in temporal and spatial dimensions
- Build and run data processing pipelines on various types of neuroscientific data, including single unit recordings, time series, and 2D/3D/4D images
- Understand basic concepts and common tools used in machine learning, including deep neural networks
- extend your Python skills using online resources

## Soft Skills
- demonstrate a professional work ethic
- be effective and productive in a remote working environment
- work collaboratively, effectively, and productively in a distributed team
- manage projects: manage time and human resources effectively to achieve specific objectives on a stated timeline
