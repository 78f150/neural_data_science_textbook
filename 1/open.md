# Open Resources

This course embraces a number of values around what could be called the "open movement", including [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), [**open science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), and [**open educational resources**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) (**OERs**), as well as crowdsourced knowledge-sharing platforms like [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org). While these three ideologies are distinct, they share a common value system emphasizing barrier-free accessibility to information, tools, and knowledge, as well as transparency. Their common goals are to empower human society by making high-quality resources available to everyone, and allowing each of us to build on the work of others, such as improving, adapting, remixing, or extending prior work. Indeed, the nonprofit [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) emphasizes that their use of the word "free" focuses more on liberty than on price. A famous quote exemplifying this is, "To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer'."
