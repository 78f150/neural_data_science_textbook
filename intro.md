# Neural Data Science in Python

This online textbook is aimed primarily at students and researchers in neuroscience and cognitive psychology who want to learn how to analyze data using Python. It is also suitable for students with a background in computer science who want to learn how to apply their skills to neuroscience. The textbook assumes no prior knowledge of Python, or any other programming language. If you do have prior knowledge of Python and want to lear how to apply it to neuroscience, you can skip the first few chapters and start with [Chapter 4](./4-viz/introduction.md).

This book will teach you the fundamentals of Python, and how to use the GitHub Copilot AI assistant to help you learn to code, and write code for you. From there, we learn additional Python in the context of using it for data science, including data visualization, and working with different types of neuroscience data, including single unit recordings, EEG, and fMRI.

This book was written to support the course [NESC 3505 *Neural Data Science*](https://neural-data-science.github.io/NESC_3505/), at [Dalhousie University](https://dal.ca). Development of the textbook is *in progress*, with frequent updates being posted.

Written by Prof. [Aaron J. Newman](https://aaronjnewman.com/), [Department of Psychology & Neuroscience](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience), [Dalhousie University](https://dal.ca), with contributions from students in his lab, including [Danny Godfrey](https://github.com/Balkazar), [Laura Elliott](https://github.com/lauraelliott210), [Brynn Harris-Shanks](https://github.com/brynnhs), [Reann Post](https://github.com/reannpost), and [Saisha Rankaduwa](https://github.com/saisha-r) as well as other generous folks from around the world (see the book's [GitHub page](https://github.com/neural-data-science/NESC_3505_textbook) for a complete list). Some of the text and code was generated using the GitHub Copilot AI assistant.


## We Love Feedback!
