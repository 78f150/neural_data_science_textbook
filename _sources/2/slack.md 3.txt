# Slack

[**Slack**](https://slack.com/) is a "business communication platform"; essentially, a social media platform designed to support communication within an organization. Slack centres around an instant-messaging platform, with public conversations organized into **channels** (for different topics or groups), and private messaging as well. Slack allows file posting/sharing, and integrates with many other software applications. For example, Slack integrates with Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others to facilitate cloud-based file sharing, and with GitHub so that any activity on a repository will be automatically posted as a message in a Slack channel.

Many students have never heard of it, but Slack is huge. The company, founded in Vancouver, Canada, went public in 2019 with a value of over US$20 billion. As with GitHub, this high valuation speaks to the widespread use of Slack in workspaces, and its value to the tech community in particular. As with GitHub, Slack uses a "freemium" business model, where it is free to use, and anyone with an email address can set up a Slack organization and invite others. While free accounts have certain limitations, they are more than adequate for the purposes of running a one-semester class.

In this class, **Slack will be the centre of our online community**. Class messages and announcements will be posted there, and all students are encouraged to post questions to a public channel for the teaching team to respond to, rather than sending an email or direct message. For team projects, teams can create closed groups for project-related communication, share files, and interface with GitHub.

A number of add-on integrations have been added too. Besides mundane ones like OneDrive, various companies have created add-ons that support polling, friendly competitions, and opportunities to meet people for a virtual coffee (or doughnut) â€” a great way to get to get to know people before forming a team.
