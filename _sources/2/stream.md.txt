# Stream

[Stream](https://web.microsoftstream.com/) is Microsoft's video hosting platform. It is, essentially, Microsoft's version of YouTube. Originally the plan for this class was to post class videos to YouTube, as it is an open platform. However, we are trialing Stream because it is tightly integrated with Teams, and seems to allow some advantages for use in the structure of a class.
