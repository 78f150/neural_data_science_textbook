# JupyterHub

JupyterLab can be run and installed on any Mac, Windows, or Linux computer. However, to avoid the pain of setup and to facilitate your work (including submitting and grading work), we have set up a server that you will connect to through a web browser on your own computer, and log in to with a personal account.

Behind the scenes, [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is the service that's running on a server somewhere that makes this happen. You really don't need to know much about JupyterHub, except that we use the term to mean "the server you connect to to run JupyterLab".
