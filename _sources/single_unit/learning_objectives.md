Once you've completed this lesson you should be able to:

### Spike trains
- define spike trains
- explain how spike train data is recorded
- describe two ways of storing spike train data: time series and spike times
- interpret raster plots and peri-stimulus time histograms
- generate those two types of visualizations

### Python
- explain what a pickle is in Python, and some advantages and disadvantages of pickling
- use subplots to plot multiple levels of data in a single graphic
- understand and properly use Python's naming convention (snake case) for variable names
- properly use whitespace in formatting your code
- consider the relative benefits of hard-coding values in your code, versus writing snippets of code that derive these values from the data itself
- use nested list comprehension

### Data Visualization
- make informed decisions about accessible design in scientific visualization, including colour map choice and interpolation methods
