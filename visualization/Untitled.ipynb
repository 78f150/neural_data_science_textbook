    "# Accessibility and Human Factors in Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you are generating plots to go into a paper or a presentation, there are a few things you can do to make sure that everyone can understand your plots:\n",
    "- Always make sure your text is large enough to read. Use the `fontsize` parameter in `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `title`, and `legend`, and `tick_params` with `labelsize` to increase the text size of the numbers on your axes.\n",
    "- Similarly, you should make your graph elements easy to see. Use `s` to increase the size of your scatterplot markers and `linewidth` to increase the sizes of your plot lines.\n",
    "- Using `color` (and nothing else) to distinguish between different plot elements will make your plots *unreadable* to anyone who is colorblind, or who happens to have a black-and-white office printer. For lines, the `linestyle` parameter lets you use different types of lines. For scatterplots, `marker` lets you change the shape of your points. If youâ€™re unsure about your colors, you can use [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) or [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) to simulate what your plots would look like to those with colorblindness.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to increase the accessibility of your plots for different formats are a set of Matplotlib style sheets borrowed from the `seaborn` package. These include `seaborn-poster` for conference posters, and `seaborn-talk` for slide presentations.\n",

    "df.T.plot(kind='bar')\n",

    "plt.show()\n",
