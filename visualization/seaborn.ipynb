    "[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is a great Python plotting package that is built on top of Matplotlib. That is, it uses Matplotlib \"under the hood\", but it offers the user a much simpler API (set of commands) that enable us to generate a variety of great-looking plots that are particularly useful in data science. You can check out Seaboarn's [examples gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) to see some of the cool stuff you can do (including plotting neuroscience data!).\n",

    "COmparing Seaborn to Matplotlib, you could say that Matplotlib givens you every sharp, hard-to-use tool in the shed, and you have to figure out how to learn them all without chopping off a finger. Fortunatley in coding you aren't likely to lose any fingers, but Seaborn gives you some DIY-friendly power tools to get data science jobs done easily and looking great. \n",
