# Data

“Data” comprises all the information you might collect in a study. The types of data collected in neuroscience research spans such a wide range that it would be impossible to document them concisely here. To give a sense of the breadth of what we might call data, we can consider that data are typically collected from individual “units”, be they humans, non-human animals, cells, etc., and could include things such as responses to questionnaires, behavioural responses (e.g., reaction times, button or lever presses), electrophysiological measurements, images, sound files, movies, or genetic information. For the purposes of this class we assume that the data are collected in some way, and stored digitally in files, typically as numbers or characters (words, sentences, etc.) — remembering that digital media like movies or sounds are, ultimately, files composed of numbers.
